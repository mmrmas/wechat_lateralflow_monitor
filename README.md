# wechat_lateralflow_monitor
a platform for purchasing flow tests and storing them in the tencent cloud as a wechat miniprogram

This miniprogram was written in 2020 and has been taken offline. It is a fully functional, but rather rudimental, sales pipeline that can serve as a WeChat miniprogram.
Code has been made available to share insights and re-use. Welcome to reach out for guidance.

This collection contains
- cloudfunctions
- miniprogram scripts
- server-side scripts (WXConnect)

For this program to work, it also needs a connection to a wechat devtools cloud database with the tables: Users, Bundles, Purchases


BACKGROUND
It was supposed to fucntion as a platform to purchase self-tests for antibiotic residue, which could be done at home, and via qr code scanning each purchase was linked to each user.This way users could track their own results in time and place, building up more knowledge on the antibiotic residue in the food they purchased.

The UX seemed a bit abstract for consumers. We modified and simplified this miniprogram for use in professional kitchens and tried to put it on the market. Unfortunately, lateral flow tests are not certified.
For this and other reasons, the interest in this technology, and the willingness to test, remained low.
